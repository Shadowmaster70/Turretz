I found Turretz in my downloads history on Google Play and downloaded it. It works well except some minor details. People who download the APK from here can transfer the game directly to their phone using a data cable.

I tested it with an emulator and unfortunately it didn't work, no Google account links were found in the filesâ€”but use a burner account if paranoid.
 
I really wish someone made a PC port for the game and I hope these files will help.
